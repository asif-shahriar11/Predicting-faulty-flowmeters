## Task 1

## Details

Flow meters are devices used to measure the volumetric or mass flow  of a fluid with ultrasound. However, these devices present serious  engineering problems that give rise to a defective meter function and  cause errors in reading the flow velocity.

In this study, we analyze a database with the characteristics of a  liquid ultrasonic flowmeter and its state (healthy or unhealthy) to know the relevant factors that cause failures in the system.

Therefore, a solution that balances accurate measurement and the necessary costs of recalibration is needed.

## Task

1. Plot a confusion matrix.

2. Predict the health state of a flowmeter given the input variablesâ€™ any required values.


### Solution


Multiple models were tested. Among them XGBoost performer best. which is a regularizing gradient boosting framework. Confusion matrix and accuracy of the models are added.
